            <h3>Maria</h3>
            <p>Before the weight lifting journal I spent too much time going through my own physical paper journal. Now that all that time wasted trying to keep track of my past workouts i've been able to put that time back into my workout. <br> A++</p>

            <h3>Jonny</h3>
            <p>No other application has hit the target unlike this one. It's my go-to when I hit the gym. I've thrown away and deleted all the other books and apps because no longer am I bogged down and spending time messing with pages or settings. The weight lifting journal has revolutionized my workout. <br> ✰✰✰✰✰/✰✰✰✰✰</p>
